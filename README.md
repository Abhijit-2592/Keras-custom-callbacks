# keras-call-backs

### Contains Random codes

Refer **dynamic_acc_loss_plottting_callback.ipynb** for the code
unfortunately bokeh isnt working on github (idk why). Thus I have given a sample image **"loss_acc_bokeh_interactive_plot.png"**
This image is static. But when executed within the code given in jupyter notebook it becomes dynamic and interactive.
The interactive tools include : PanTool,BoxZoomTool,WheelZoomTool,ResetTool,HoverTool,BoxSelectTool,SaveTool.
